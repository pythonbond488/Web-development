        <p>
 Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. 
 It involves three main areas: front-end development (the design and user interface of a website),
 back-end development (server-side functionality and databases), and full-stack development 
 (a combination of both). Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to 
 create the look and feel, while back-end developers work with server-side languages such as PHP,
 Python, or Ruby to handle data storage and business logic. Web developers must ensure their websites
 are responsive, secure and optimized for performance, delivering a seamless user experience across
 various devices and browsers.
